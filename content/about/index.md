I am a 40-something father of two living near the Great Lakes of North America. I play a lot of games, write a little poetry, and do my best to read a lot of books, which I edit for a living. But don't be surprised if my writing here is sloppy, wordy, or otherwise ill-formed. I'm not going to beat myself over the head trying to make it perfect.

Booper is a semi-obscure reference to *Twin Peaks* and BooperDCSS was created with the intention of contributing more to one of the best computer games you can play anywhere, [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](https://crawl.develz.org/).
