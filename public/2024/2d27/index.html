I’ve been playing my solo game for a couple of weeks now and have made a substantial (but I think logical) change to the combat rules that I want to share. I am aware other people must have had this idea already, but it has made a big impression on me.\nImagine this for a moment.\nMy party is searching through a network of caves, hoping to find a holy symbol that the leading character has seen in a vision. It is an artifact of great power, mythic even, but it’s also unstable. Dangerous. Maybe evil.\nThe caves are notorious for being filled with kobolds and goblins and there are countless rumors and legends about people disappearing inside them. Entire caverns are said to move around, as if they magically switch positions within the caves.\nPeople lose their memories and emerge days later, unsure what has happened to them.\nAnimals that venture into the caves sometimes emerge mutated and sickly.\nThe party has been dilligent about gathering this information. They’re ready for this. They are moving carefully, keeping quiet, looking out for traps…\n… and I am rolling for random encounters at semi-regular intervals. What they are doing is dangerous; some would call it crazy. I don’t want it to be easy.\nAnd then I roll up a pair of goblins emerging from the darkness.\nTo the rulebook! First things first: check for surprise. Roll the dice. The party is surprised. Damn. Next, check for reaction. Are the goblins hostile? Roll the dice. They definitely are. My party is treating their home like a tourist attraction after all. This is going to be bad.\nOr maybe it goes another way. Check for surprise. Roll the dice. Nope, no surprises here. Maybe we should check for reaction anyway. I like that rule. Are the goblins hostile? Oh yeah. Bad luck for the party, but they want blood. Now, roll for initiative. Oh this is going to be a bloody mess for my level one adventurers: the goblins have the upper hand!\nBut wait a second. My party was moving carefully. They were on the lookout for traps, and you better believe they were listening for footfalls, conversation, and other noises. This place is a death trap and they are scared to be here, but they are smart enough to look for signs of life. And how were these goblins moving through the cave? Can they see in the dark? Or do they have a lantern too? Would my party have seen it coming? And would the goblins have seen our light in advance?\nI recently read a great post by Jared Sinclair called “Rules Elide” and Its Consequences. You should read it, but I’m going to summarize it for the purposes of this post and offer this basic formulation of its argument: RPG rules get rid of details about actions that players are uninterested in managing and allows them to focus on what they enjoy without removing that action from the game. In other words, rules get rid of details when they are a bother, or they simplify complex actions that are hard to fictionalize in a convncing and consistent way.\nThe example of lockpicking in that post is perfect. You can either describe the methodology for picking a lock methodically, thus convincing the GM that the lock has been picked, or you can flip a coin and pick the lock if it lands heads up. Do you care enough about the locks to go all out in your description? Or do you really just want to get it out of the way so you can get back to the exploration you care about?\nThis kind of elision happens all over the place when we play RPGs, and that’s fine. But sometimes, when we sort through the details, we stumble on ideas and surprises that make the “more important” bits even richer than they might have been on their own. Sometimes, it is just as much fun to slow down, think through the fiction of the situation, and bring the world of the game to life by dealing with its smaller details. And I think the beginning of combat encounters in old-school D\u0026D games benefit in a special way from just such a detailed approach, whether you care more about actual combat, the fiction of the setting, world-building, or some other element of play.\nWhat the hell are the monsters doing? There’s a great post by Nick LS Whelan over at Papers \u0026 Pencils that completely reimagines RPG encounter tables. Because I want to experience playing at least some of Swords \u0026 Wizardry as written, I decided not to completely revamp the process, but I did find some inspiration in Nick’s idea of a “wrinkle.”\nWhat’s a wrinkle?\nIn short, monsters should be doing something when you come across them. They don’t exist merely as obstacles for the party, but have a life of their own, probably one that contributes to the fiction of the place where they exist. This is a wrinkle because it takes the idea of an encounter out of the purely combative and bunches it up, giving it texture and meaning in multiple dimensions.\nI love this idea, so I took the d30 table and edited it slightly for an easy d12 or d20 roll. In total imitation of Nick’s idea, I use d12 dice for animal encounters and d20 for creatures that behave more or less like humans. If I roll an animal-like activity on a human-like creature, I just improvise. It’s not hard imagining any of these activites in a person, a kobold, or a dragon.\nThe “Monsters Doing” Table Roll Activity/Status 1 Lost 2 Hurt 3 Trapped 4 Sleeping 5 Eating 6 Tracking prey 7 Lying in ambush 8 Seeking a mate 9 Starving 10 Fleeing from something 11 Resting, but aware 12 Marking its territory 13 Scavenging 14 Building a camp 15 Searching for something 16 Holding captives 17 Cooking 18 Drugs/drinking 19 Destroying something 20 Performing a ritual But if the monsters are doing something, doesn’t that alter what happens when you encounter them? Might that not create surprise? Or alert the party to their existence in advance?\nIf a group of goblins are found building a camp or holding captives, don’t you think they would make a lot of noise? What if they were cooking or performing a ritual? Would the party notice before they encountered them?\nSuddenly this flat thing (rolling for surprise) has dramatic potential. Who are the captives? What ritual are the goblins performing? Oh god, why did the party have to stumble on 2d6 giant rats in the middle of their mating rituals?\nHow do they react? How do you react? One of the most helpful combat notes in Swords \u0026 Wizardry is concerned with monster reaction. It’s brief and maybe a little easy to miss, but it’s juicy:\nTake note: Monsters do not always leap to the attack. Unless they are on the alert for intruders, the Referee may roll 2d6 to determine whether the monsters attack if they surprise the adventurers. On a roll of 2–6, the monsters are hostile and attack; on a roll of 7–9, the monsters withhold judgment and wait to see if the adventurers are hostile; on a roll of 10–12, the monsters have a positive initial reaction to seeing the adventurers and might even be convinced to offer some help — if they are well paid, of course! (from page 35 of the Complete Revised edition; emphasis mine)\nIf the monsters surprise the party, I can roll to see how the monsters react. Maybe they have the upper hand but don’t realize it. Or maybe they aren’t willing to engage in a battle because they are more concerned with another task. It’s random, but it gives the situation more life.\nBut if the monsters are cooking, could they possibly surprise the party? Isn’t it more likely the party would surprise them? Why roll on a table at all when the fiction established by the “Monster Doing” roll already tells us so much?\nRolling for monster reactions may still be relevant if their reaction isn’t clear from their activity (if goblins are patrolling, they’re looking for intruders, and are probably ready to face them, but maybe the party greatly outnumbers them). Here is a place where we can replace the rules with narrative, drama, and world-building, and in solo play the opportunity to engage in any of those is almost always worth taking.\nRoll for uh… wait, didn’t we see them first? Up to this point, we’ve transformed two simple dice rolls (surprise, reaction) into a chance for interacting with the fictional world of the game. My party of cave-diving opportunists might have an encounter that looks like this:\nRoll random encounter. It’s a pair of goblins. Roll on the “Monster Doing” table. They are clearly searching for something. The sound of rocks, small boulders, and chatter were easily discernable from (2d6 x 10) feet away. I made that last bit up on the spot, but I could create rules for sound traveling if I wanted. Also note, it’s OK to retroactively change the encounter and put the party well outside the goblin’s notice; encounter isn’t the same as contact.\nAs the party moves forward silently and nears a turn in the tunnels, they spy a flash a light from further into the caves. They decide to dim their own light and agree that the thief should scout ahead as quietly as possible.\nThe thief is able to hide behind a large outcropping of stone and sees two goblins working frantically at a pile of loose debris in the corner of a large opening in the cave (roll 2d20 to come up with random room dimensions). The floor drops away 10 or 15 feet, but the ceiling climbs at least 30 feet at the same time. The thief is above them. The dull glow of a lantern reaches nearly to the top.\nOne goblin speaks in the common tongue: “Gravik swears this is where he fell. The (roll on random table) key has to be here somewhere.”\nWhat a discovery! An encounter that might have inevitably led to combat (roll surprise, roll reaction, get those spells ready) becomes an encounter where the party gets new information and, should they desire, the opportunity to surprise the goblins themselves.\nNow the party approaches the opening in the tunnels together. They have agreed the key the goblins mentioned is important and they are willing to kill the goblins for the opportunity to find it themselves. After all, they had been ambushed by goblins just a few hours earlier. These aren’t a peaceful group and… well, the party isn’t exactly a model of good behavior and virtue either.\nSo roll intiative on the combat!\n…\nOr just give the party the upper hand.\nNot only can they surprise the goblins, but the fiction of the game has clearly established that they are going to move on the goblins’ position first and likely have the advantage of shock on their side.\nBut what if the party is weak? What if they are hurt?\nNow, with the table in play, the party can make a number of choices beyond simply risking death. Do they wait for the goblins to leave? Do they run away? Do they watch and wait for more information?\nThe game is no longer on rails. It’s alive and capable of moving in many more directions, many of which can be deepened by use of an oracle system. And all thanks to a table that asks a single question: what the heck are these monsters doing when the party encounters them?\nA new order of operations Since introducing the “Monsters Doing” table to my sessions, I have rewritten the order of operations for combat in Swords \u0026 Wizardry. Since surprise, reaction, and initiative can be folded into a single roll in some cases, I’ve found it helpful to think about when and how I should make rolls depending on the context.\nI will conclude this post with that process, in case others find it useful, and will only add that this has made my solo games a lot more fun and a lot more unpredictable. I can imagine writing a variety of such “doing” tables based on the environment or context of play (caves will be different than mountainous paths, and both would differ from river travel, etc.) and a part of me is tempted to write more of these in the near future. For now, though, the idea is enough on its own to make solo play a lot more unpredictable and a lot more fun.\nNew combat procudes Roll on the “Monsters Doing” table. Roll 1d12 for animals, 1d20 for human-like creatures.\n(optional) If the result necessitates it, check encounter distance by rolling (1d6 x 10 feet). This is the distance between the party and the monsters.\n(optional) Determine surprise if needed.\nRemember, your characters might have heard or suspected the presence of something in a room before entering it. Does their lamp light allow for some suggestion of what is ahead? Could they have smelled something? Felt something? Monsters don’t appear from a void of sensation, so think carefully about what must have been happening when your party encountered this group. Remember, it’s your game: it’s OK to retroactively change the circumstances to fit the fiction! (optional) Check monster reaction, but only if necessary. In combination with the “Monsters Doing” table, you may get either a sensible or a contradictory combination of information from the reaction roll. If the “Doing” table is enough, narrate instead of worrying about this.\nDeclare Spells\n(optional) Roll initiative if needed. The fiction established in steps 1-3 may already tell you enough.\nIf this is your second time through the combat loop, rolling initiative may still be necessary. But the fiction of the combat can obviate it. Play in a way that feels comfortable and consistent to you (or to your group, if you’re playing outside the solo bubble). When in doubt, check the logic of your fiction before resorting to dice. There may be something buried in the moments leading up to the encounter that make initiative unnecessary. But don’t fret if it feels uncomfortable. Initiative isn’t bad, but it isn’t always necessary either. Movement and Missiles Phase\nMelee and Spells Phase (multi-shot missile results here)\nComplete the Round (check for spell effects and other details not resolved in the previous steps)\nReturn to step five\n",

<p>My party is searching through a network of caves, hoping to find a holy symbol that the leading character has seen in a vision. It is an artifact of great power, mythic even, but it&rsquo;s also unstable. Dangerous. Maybe evil.</p>
<p>The caves are notorious for being filled with kobolds and goblins and there are countless rumors and legends about people disappearing inside them. Entire caverns are said to move around, as if they magically switch positions within the caves.</p>
<p>People lose their memories and emerge days later, unsure what has happened to them.</p>
<p>Animals that venture into the caves sometimes emerge mutated and sickly.</p>
<p>The party has been dilligent about gathering this information. They&rsquo;re ready for this. They are moving carefully, keeping quiet, looking out for traps&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; and I am rolling for random encounters at semi-regular intervals. What they are doing is dangerous; some would call it crazy. I don&rsquo;t want it to be easy.</p>
<p>And then I roll up a pair of goblins emerging from the darkness.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="to-the-rulebook">To the rulebook!<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#to-the-rulebook">#</a></h3>
<p>First things first: check for surprise. Roll the dice. The party is surprised. Damn. Next, check for reaction. Are the goblins hostile? Roll the dice. They definitely are. My party is treating their home like a tourist attraction after all. This is going to be bad.</p>
<p>Or maybe it goes another way. Check for surprise. Roll the dice. Nope, no surprises here. Maybe we should check for reaction anyway. I like that rule. Are the goblins hostile? Oh yeah. Bad luck for the party, but they want blood. Now, roll for initiative. Oh this is going to be a bloody mess for my level one adventurers: the goblins have the upper hand!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But wait a second. My party was moving carefully. They were on the lookout for traps, and you better believe they were listening for footfalls, conversation, and other noises. This place is a death trap and they are scared to be here, but they are smart enough to look for signs of life. And how were these goblins moving through the cave? Can they see in the dark? Or do they have a lantern too? Would my party have seen it coming? And would the goblins have seen our light in advance?</p>
<p>I recently read a great post by Jared Sinclair called <a href="https://jared.blot.im/rules-elide-and-its-consequences"><em>&ldquo;Rules Elide&rdquo; and Its Consequences</em></a>. You should read it, but I&rsquo;m going to summarize it for the purposes of this post and offer this basic formulation of its argument: RPG rules get rid of details about actions that players are uninterested in managing and allows them to focus on what they enjoy without removing that action from the game. In other words, rules get rid of details when they are a bother, or they simplify complex actions that are hard to fictionalize in a convncing and consistent way.</p>
<p>The example of lockpicking in that post is perfect. You can either describe the methodology for picking a lock methodically, thus convincing the GM that the lock has been picked, or you can flip a coin and pick the lock if it lands heads up. Do you care enough about the locks to go all out in your description? Or do you really just want to get it out of the way so you can get back to the exploration you care about?</p>
<p>This kind of elision happens all over the place when we play RPGs, and that&rsquo;s fine. But sometimes, when we sort through the details, we stumble on ideas and surprises that make the &ldquo;more important&rdquo; bits even richer than they might have been on their own. Sometimes, it is just as much fun to slow down, think through the fiction of the situation, and bring the world of the game to life by dealing with its smaller details. And I think the beginning of combat encounters in old-school D&amp;D games benefit in a special way from just such a detailed approach, whether you care more about actual combat, the fiction of the setting, world-building, or some other element of play.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a great post by Nick LS Whelan over at <a href="https://www.paperspencils.com/structuring-encounter-tables-amended-restated/">Papers &amp; Pencils</a> that completely reimagines RPG encounter tables. Because I want to experience playing at least some of <em>Swords &amp; Wizardry</em> as written, I decided not to completely revamp the process, but I did find some inspiration in Nick&rsquo;s idea of a &ldquo;wrinkle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a wrinkle?</p>
<p>In short, monsters should be doing something when you come across them. They don&rsquo;t exist merely as obstacles for the party, but have a life of their own, probably one that contributes to the fiction of the place where they exist. This is a wrinkle because it takes the idea of an encounter out of the purely combative and bunches it up, giving it texture and meaning in multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>I love this idea, so I took the d30 table and edited it
slightly for an easy d12 or d20 roll. In total imitation
of Nick&rsquo;s idea, I use d12 dice for animal encounters
and d20 for creatures that behave more or less like
humans. If I roll an animal-like activity on a
human-like creature, I just improvise. It&rsquo;s not hard
imagining any of these activites in a person, a kobold,
or a dragon.</p>

<p>But if the monsters are doing something, doesn&rsquo;t that alter what happens when you encounter them? Might that not create surprise? Or alert the party to their existence in advance?</p>
<p>If a group of goblins are found building a camp or holding captives, don&rsquo;t you think they would make a lot of noise? What if they were cooking or performing a ritual? Would the party notice before they encountered them?</p>
<p>Suddenly this flat thing (rolling for surprise) has dramatic potential. Who are the captives? What ritual are the goblins performing? Oh god, why did the party have to stumble on 2d6 giant rats <em>in the middle of their mating rituals?</em></p>
<h2 id="how-do-they-react-how-do-you-react">How do they react? How do you react?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-do-they-react-how-do-you-react">#</a></h2>
<p>One of the most helpful combat notes in <em>Swords &amp; Wizardry</em> is concerned with monster reaction. It&rsquo;s brief and maybe a little easy to miss, but it&rsquo;s juicy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Take note: <strong>Monsters do not always leap to the attack. Unless they are on the alert for intruders, the Referee may roll 2d6 to determine whether the monsters attack if they surprise the adventurers.</strong> On a roll of 2–6, the monsters are hostile and attack; on a roll of 7–9, the monsters withhold judgment and wait to see if the adventurers are hostile; on a roll of 10–12, the monsters have a positive initial reaction to seeing the adventurers and might even be convinced to offer some help — if they are well paid, of course!</em> (from page 35 of the <em>Complete Revised</em> edition; emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the monsters surprise the party, I can roll to see how the monsters react. Maybe they have the upper hand but don&rsquo;t realize it. Or maybe they aren&rsquo;t willing to engage in a battle because they are more concerned with another task. It&rsquo;s random, but it gives the situation more life.</p>
<p>But if the monsters are cooking, could they possibly surprise the party? Isn&rsquo;t it more likely the party would surprise them? Why roll on a table at all when the fiction established by the &ldquo;Monster Doing&rdquo; roll already tells us so much?</p>
<p>Rolling for monster reactions may still be relevant if their reaction isn&rsquo;t clear from their activity (if goblins are patrolling, they&rsquo;re looking for intruders, and are probably ready to face them, but maybe the party greatly outnumbers them). Here is a place where we can replace the rules with narrative, drama, and world-building, and in solo play the opportunity to engage in any of those is almost always worth taking.</p>
<h2 id="roll-for-uh-wait-didnt-we-see-them-first">Roll for uh&hellip; wait, didn&rsquo;t we see them first?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#roll-for-uh-wait-didnt-we-see-them-first">#</a></h2>
<p>Up to this point, we&rsquo;ve transformed two simple dice rolls (surprise, reaction) into a chance for interacting with the fictional world of the game. My party of cave-diving opportunists might have an encounter that looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Roll random encounter. It&rsquo;s a pair of goblins. Roll on the &ldquo;Monster Doing&rdquo; table. They are clearly searching for something. The sound of rocks, small boulders, and chatter were easily discernable from (2d6 x 10) feet away. I made that last bit up on the spot, but I could create rules for sound traveling if I wanted. Also note, it&rsquo;s OK to retroactively change the encounter and put the party well outside the goblin&rsquo;s notice; encounter isn&rsquo;t the same as contact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the party moves forward silently and nears a turn in the tunnels, they spy a flash a light from further into the caves. They decide to dim their own light and agree that the thief should scout ahead as quietly as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thief is able to hide behind a large outcropping of stone and sees two goblins working frantically at a pile of loose debris in the corner of a large opening in the cave (roll 2d20 to come up with random room dimensions). The floor drops away 10 or 15 feet, but the ceiling climbs at least 30 feet at the same time. The thief is above them. The dull glow of a lantern reaches nearly to the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One goblin speaks in the common tongue: &ldquo;Gravik swears this is where he fell. The (roll on random table) key has to be here somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What a discovery! An encounter that might have inevitably led to combat (roll surprise, roll reaction, get those spells ready) becomes an encounter where the party gets new information and, should they desire, the opportunity to surprise the goblins themselves.</p>
<p>Now the party approaches the opening in the tunnels together. They have agreed the key the goblins mentioned is important and they are willing to kill the goblins for the opportunity to find it themselves. After all, they had been ambushed by goblins just a few hours earlier. These aren&rsquo;t a peaceful group and&hellip; well, the party isn&rsquo;t exactly a model of good behavior and virtue either.</p>
<p>So roll intiative on the combat!</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><strong><em>Or just give the party the upper hand.</em></strong></p>
<p>Not only can they surprise the goblins, but the fiction of the game has clearly established that they are going to move on the goblins&rsquo; position first and likely have the advantage of shock on their side.</p>
<p>But what if the party is weak? What if they are hurt?</p>
<p>Now, with the table in play, the party can make a number of choices beyond simply <em>risking death</em>. Do they wait for the goblins to leave? Do they run away? Do they watch and wait for more information?</p>
<p>The game is no longer on rails. It&rsquo;s alive and capable of moving in many more directions, many of which can be deepened by use of an oracle system. And all thanks to a table that asks a single question: what the heck are these monsters doing when the party encounters them?</p>
<h2 id="a-new-order-of-operations">A new order of operations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-new-order-of-operations">#</a></h2>
<p>Since introducing the &ldquo;Monsters Doing&rdquo; table to my sessions, I have rewritten the order of operations for combat in <em>Swords &amp; Wizardry</em>. Since surprise, reaction, and initiative can be folded into a single roll in some cases, I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to think about when and how I should make rolls depending on the context.</p>
<p>I will conclude this post with that process, in case others find it useful, and will only add that this has made my solo games a lot more fun and a lot more unpredictable. I can imagine writing a variety of such &ldquo;doing&rdquo; tables based on the environment or context of play (caves will be different than mountainous paths, and both would differ from river travel, etc.) and a part of me is tempted to write more of these in the near future. For now, though, the idea is enough on its own to make solo play a lot more unpredictable and a lot more fun.</p>
<h3 id="new-combat-procudes">New combat procudes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#new-combat-procudes">#</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Roll on the &ldquo;Monsters Doing&rdquo; table. Roll 1d12 for animals, 1d20 for human-like creatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(optional) If the result necessitates it, check encounter distance by rolling (1d6 x 10 feet). This is the distance between the party and the monsters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(optional) Determine surprise if needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember, your characters might have heard or suspected the presence of something in a room before entering it. Does their lamp light allow for some suggestion of what is ahead? Could they have smelled something? Felt something?</li>
<li>Monsters don&rsquo;t appear from a void of sensation, so think carefully about what must have been happening when your party encountered this group. Remember, it&rsquo;s your game: it&rsquo;s OK to retroactively change the circumstances to fit the fiction!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>(optional) Check monster reaction, but only if necessary. In combination with the &ldquo;Monsters Doing&rdquo; table, you may get either a sensible or a contradictory combination of information from the reaction roll. If the &ldquo;Doing&rdquo; table is enough, narrate instead of worrying about this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declare Spells</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(optional) Roll initiative if needed. The fiction established in steps 1-3 may already tell you enough.</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is your second time through the combat loop, rolling initiative may still be necessary. But the fiction of the combat can obviate it. Play in a way that feels comfortable and consistent to you (or to your group, if you&rsquo;re playing outside the solo bubble).</li>
<li>When in doubt, check the logic of your fiction before resorting to dice. There may be something buried in the moments leading up to the encounter that make initiative unnecessary. But don&rsquo;t fret if it feels uncomfortable. Initiative isn&rsquo;t <em>bad</em>, but it isn&rsquo;t always necessary either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Movement and Missiles Phase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melee and Spells Phase (multi-shot missile results here)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete the Round (check for spell effects and other details not resolved in the previous steps)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return to step five</p>
</li>
</ol>
