  "articleBody": "The Quick Version I have always been enticed by tabletop roleplaying games (RPGs) and have almost always been frustrated in my attempts to play them. Now, I’m taking that frustration and channeling it into a running a solo campaign in the hope of converting it for group play sometime in the future. This blog will document my experience of learning to play solo RPGs and hopefully capture some useful thoughts that others can use when coming to the hobby. It will also give a good excuse to write. Writing has always improved my mental health and improving my mental health has always improved my thinking.\nA Little Bio I have played computer roleplaying games (CRPGs) and so-called1 Japanese roleplaying games (JRPGs) almost my entire life, ever since I read about Final Fantasy I and picked up a copy for the NES way back in 1990 (thanks, mom and dad). The strategy guide published by Nintendo Power absolutely contributed to my obsession. There were days and weeks that I spent more time looking through that guide than I did actually playing the game. There’s always been something special about leafing through RPG books.\nMy preoccupation with tabletop RPGs is almost as old. It was spurred by a friend’s older brother, who left his copy of Werewolf: The Apocalypse laying around during a sleepover. I was ten and had no idea how a book could be a game, but the artwork was amazing and I got my first taste of being addicted to character creation that night (or to the idea of it, at least). It felt complicated and a little intimidating, but the concept was exciting. Adding depth and an internal life to the characters I had played in video games felt like a big deal. I kind of did that anyway when I imagined being Cecil in Final Fantasy IV or what it must be like to experience the loss that Cyan does in VI, but the tabletop variety gave that play more shape and centrality.\nSadly, my group of friends never played Werewolf. That older brother refused to even show us how, thus beginning a pattern that repeated a lot through my life.\nI bought a copy of Vampire: The Dark Ages when I was 15, but had trouble finding guidance on how to run it and to this day have never actually played it. It wasn’t terribly easy finding tabletop groups where I lived, and I knew more people interested in console gaming. There was little to no guidance available and almost no one was interested in figuring it out with me. I was either too young or my friends were too interested in doing something else with their free time. I was lonely enough and unsure enough of myself to go where my friends did.\nIt would be another 20 years before I actually sat down at a table to play an RPG with other people. A local game shop had a Blades in the Dark night and the GM had a reputation for being very good at what he did. I signed up, had a blast, and bought a copy of the book that same night. A couple of months later, I began my own Blades campaign via Discord with a few people I knew who were specifically interested in that system. It ran for around four or five sessions and felt great. I found that I loved how creative the game asked me to be. I was co-creating worlds, acting, putting together maps, drawing up histories… in short, exercising my brain in a way that made me feel good like few other hobbies ever have.\nWhen the pandemic hit, life got a little harder and scheduling games became almost impossible. My work schedule and private responsibilities made even virtual events a challenge. But my imagination had been re-ignited and I still loved the big core rule books, their artwork, and the endless tables describing how the game might be played. Plus, I wanted to play more systems, roll more characters, and try to get a sense of what made all these games so different. I bought Dungeon Crawl Classics, The Burning Wheel, and Mörk Borg and spent a lot of time learning each of them. I read histories about Dungeons \u0026 Dragons, watched videos on the differences between B/X and BECMI, spent evenings reading forums explaining what retroclones were and why they existed… but I still didn’t get a chance to play. It could have easily felt like a waste of time, but I found all the little details just as compelling as the books.\nGetting to the point Then, in January of 2024, I stumbled on Me, Myself, and Die!, Trevor Devall’s Youtube series on solo tabletop roleplaying. I watched a couple of episodes from the first season and was instantly excited to try it myself. Watching him roll up Simon’s history and draw gameplay features from a variety of books was revelatory. I could finally put all my books to use!\nWhich is what I want to document here.\nOver the last month-and-a-half, I’ve assembled an oracle and mapping system for myself using a variety of free and paid-for resources. I also did a little research into OSR gaming (because I wanted to play something that emphasized improvisation) and decided that Swords \u0026 Wizardry Complete Revised would be my core gaming system.\nNot only is the artwork and writing excellent (and I appreciate the sensitivity to issues of ancestry and gender that Matt Finch seems to have), but the rules are relatively simple and flexible, making homebrew and hacks easy to implement. It’s an added bonus that it is compatible with most OSR modules and adventures and cheap in PDF form. Compared to other systems, it has a very low barrier to entry.\nRecording my successes and failures with these systems will be valuable to me on its own, but if anything I write is of help to other people trying to play tabletop RPGs (solo or otherwise), all the better. That’s my goal: play the game, write about it, learn from my mistakes, and maybe help some other people along the way.\nEventually, I hope my experiments will lead to a campaign that I can play with others. In the meantime, I’ll be rolling dice and writing about what happens when I do.\nThe classification of RPGs into “computer” (or “western”) and “Japanese” categories is less helpful than it at first appears. It’s more of a proxy for the difference between computer and console games in the ’80s and ’90s, but even that is fuzzy. There has been a lot written about this lately. Check out Rowan Kaiser’s article at Engadget for one argument against the accuracy of this taxonomy. There’s a decent Wiki entry on the subject as well. ↩︎\n",

<p>I have always been enticed by tabletop roleplaying games (RPGs) and have almost always been frustrated in my attempts to play them.

<p>I have played computer roleplaying games (CRPGs) and so-called<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Japanese roleplaying games (JRPGs) almost my entire life, ever since I read about <em>Final Fantasy I</em> and picked up a copy for the NES way back in 1990 (thanks, mom and dad). <a href="https://archive.org/details/Nintendo_Power_Strategy_Guide_Final_Fantasy_Nintendo_Power_017_1990">The strategy guide published by <em>Nintendo Power</em></a> absolutely contributed to my obsession.

I kind of did that anyway when I imagined being Cecil in <em>Final Fantasy IV</em> or what it must be like to experience the loss that Cyan does in <em>VI</em>, but the tabletop variety gave that play more shape and centrality.</p>
<p>Sadly, my group of friends never played <em>Werewolf</em>. That older brother refused to even show us how, thus beginning a pattern that repeated a lot through my life.</p>
<p>I bought a copy of <em>Vampire: The Dark Ages</em> when I was 15, but had trouble finding guidance on how to run it and to this day have never actually played it.

I bought <em>Dungeon Crawl Classics</em>, <em>The Burning Wheel</em>, and <em>Mörk Borg</em> and spent a lot of time learning each of them. I read histories about <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, watched videos on the differences between B/X and BECMI, spent evenings reading forums explaining what retroclones were and why they existed&hellip; but I still didn&rsquo;t get a chance to play.

<p>Then, in January of 2024, I stumbled on <em>Me, Myself, and Die!</em>, Trevor Devall&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtiBzkVoYrugJkrpW7_75Ag">Youtube series</a> on solo tabletop roleplaying.
