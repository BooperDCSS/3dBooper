  "articleBody": "The Short Version There’s no way I can write a succint and comprehensive guide to selecting the “best” core rulebook for use in a solo RPG. There is probably no such thing, and there are too may systems I have never played anyway; and too many more I have never even read. But I did a lot of research before making a choice for myself and I can share why I landed on Swords \u0026 Wizardry Complete Revised. Here’s the short version:\nAdaptable and flexible systems are more important to me than almost anything else. Once I stopped worrying about the “perfect” system and paid close attention to what I wanted my system to do for me, the decision almost made itself. I am most interested in building lore, developing characters, and forcing them to make difficult decisions, so finding something with snappy combat mattered. I like fighting just fine, but I don’t want to spend all my time there. Looking through OSR systems seemed a natural first choice (more on that below). Swords and Wizardry Complete Revised offers a rules-light system that encourages improvisation and the creation of house rules. That alone is a great foundation for solo play. It’s inexpensive even in its complete version. Giving it a shot costs very little. It is compatible with a ton of cheap, easy-to-find, and well-written material that can be found all over the Internet, including a whole host of classic D\u0026D modules. It offers an expanded ruleset without over-complicating the game and is extremely easy to learn because it is so informative and inviting to new players unfamiliar with the hobby. In summary, it combines a low barrier to access with a comprehensive system that is easy to hack and modify for solo gameplay. It also implicitly acknowledges D\u0026D’s history of racism and colonialism. The small modifications it makes to common RPG terminology matter and I believe future players of my campaign will appreciate it. There honestly aren’t many major changes of that kind in the book, but what is there is a good start.\nAs I have already said, there probably aren’t too many bad system choices for solo play within the OSR constellation of games. As I’ll point out in future posts, the oracle system for solo play probably matters a lot more.\nQuick note: I link to DriveThruRPG because they host free official content from various publishers. Using their site is largely a matter of convenience. I do not work for them nor do I make money from them if you click on my links.\nNow, here’s the long version.\nStarting with D\u0026D I decided to try solo roleplaying after watching the inaugural episode of Trevor Devall’s Me, Myself, and Die!, but it never occured to me to use the same system he does, which is Savage Worlds. I’m an RPG fan who has never actually played Dungeons \u0026 Dragons, so I wanted to take a stab at D\u0026D game, or something like it. Sticking to just the official D\u0026D systems, there is no shortage of options. They include:\nBasic/Expert D\u0026D, or B/X. There are actually a couple of versions of this, but I’m going to treat it as a unified thing for this post. BECMI, which is actually a series of five books, the first two of which are essentially revisions of the B/X books. AD\u0026D and all of its subsequent editions. 5E or fifth edition, which is by far the most-played tabletop RPG in the United States. and even Original D\u0026D, often called “OD\u0026D” or “0e.” This is the original game that came as a boxed set of three “little brown books” (you’ll see them referred to as “LBBs” a lot). Distinguishing them all isn’t very difficult, but the landscape is complicated by the existence of “retroclones”, which are basically copies of the old D\u0026D rulesets modified in a variety of ways, usually to make the rules clearer and the games easier to play. Many of them are inexpensive, and some are even free, which makes investigating them easy enough. Speaking broadly, they are almost all written and championed by “OSR” enthusiasts. “OSR” stands for “old school renaissance” and it refers both to a style of roleplaying and to the community of people who play and write about old-school style RPGs.\nWhat makes an RPG old-school? There are entire articles written about this, but for my purposes an RPG is old-school if it emphasizes spontaneity and flexibility in gameplay rulings over strict adherence to the rules as written. To offer a ludicrous but illustrative example: does one of your players want to cartwheel through a dungeon encounter with swords taped to their arms and legs in an effort to mow through a mob of kobolds like a combine harvester? Make them describe how they do it first, then try to come up with a rule to determine whether they are successful. There isn’t a feat to refer to in the rules, but that doesn’t mean the effort is off limits, so work with the player to make it a reality (and possibly a hilarious failure). It’s old-school in some sense because the lack of a rule doesn’t imply the impossibility of the play.\nWikipedia offers a decent overview of it if you want to read more, and I will fill in some more detail below.\nBut I want to talk a little about why I went with an OSR game in the first place and then I want to focus on the four things that were important to me when deciding which game I would choose.\nWhy the OSR? When I watched Trevor Devall play, I lit up at the way he created his characters and worlds more than I did at the combat. What mattered wasn’t which dice he was rolling or the precise rules for how he resolved his conflicts, but the way he used his system to navigate the process of being both a player and a gamemaster (GM) at the same time. He generated drama, surprise, tension, comedy, and some fantastic crescendos with little more than random tables and an interest in the materials of his world. Watching him improvise was a ton of fun, and he had an easy time using multiple resources within the same game. They were compatible because they didn’t depend on exclusive rules.\nThis convinced me that working with a simplified or relatively light ruleset would be best.\nWhy?\nFirst, I’m an inexperienced GM and player. The easier a game is to run, the easier it will be for me to get into the swing of playing it.\nSecond, I wanted the rules of the game to guide me, but I didn’t want to spend sessions looking up complex rules for feats, skill checks, persuasion, ability modifiers, and so on. I’ve played games with rules that actually get in the way of having fun, and while that can be overcome with experience, I wanted to avoid that obstacle as much as possible.\nThird, being able to synthesize rules, ideas, monsters, and other assets from a variety of resources was intriguing because I have so many books in my collection already. Using them together means engaging with more of my collection, but it also means having more options.\nThis describes many OSR rulesets. The entire philosophy behind the way they are played includes principles like “rulings over rules” and “let them [the players] off the rails.” In other words, they emphasize improvisation, creativity, and rules-light gaming while still encouraging consistency, challenge, and logical consequence. Generating house rules and rolling with the punches is expected. That’s exactly what I wanted, especially since playing solo requires utilizing a second set of rules to simulate the presence of a separate GM (again, I’ll talk about this more in my post on oracles).\nI could have picked a system written for solo play in mind. Lots of these exist, and some of them can be used for a multiplayer campaign, but I kept floating in the OSR’s direction because of that improvisational emphasis.\nThe Four Factors Having settled on something within the OSR universe, I still had a large number of rulebooks to sort through. Here’s just a small sampling of the possibilities:\nOSRIC Old School Essentials Basic Fantasy Labyrinth Lord White Box: Fantastic Medieval Adventure Game Mörk Borg Dungeon Crawl Classics And, of course, Swords \u0026 Wizardry Complete Revised. Several of these are offered for free as PDFs, but what is offered in the free versions varies from book to book. Some such editions are missing artwork or they only provide a small subsection of their rules and tools, usually those identified as a part of their system reference document (SRD).\nBasic Fantasy actually offers its complete ruleset for free in digital form, along with literally every single one of its modules and expansions. And printed versions of many of its books can be had for cheap through Amazon or Lulu’s print-on-demand services. This was very nearly the system I decided to use because it wasn’t going to cost me a thing to run it.\nThen I read White Box: Fantastic Medieval Adventure and was amazed. The entire book is brief (144 pp.), well-written, well-organized, and free. I read through it in less than a day and felt like I knew the system before I was finished. It features minimal, but helpful advice on how to run the game and includes a lot of monster and treasure information, which makes getting started a breeze. I figured I could combine it with content from Basic Fantasy and be ready to go. It also has three of the four most important features of a core book for my purposes:\nIt is rules-light, with an emphasis on improvisation and house rules. It is inexpensive. Not having to invest a lot matters to me, and some of the most popular rule sets are relatively expensive even in PDF form. It is compatible with a lot of OSR content, including modules originally designed for other versions of D\u0026D. But then I found out White Box was based on something called Swords and Wizardry and that game had a brand new edition that had just been released. It took only a glance at its sample materials and table of contents to realize that this was my system of of choice. It had the same three features as White Box, but it hit on the fourth and maybe most important feature:\nIt offers an expanded ruleset without over-complicating the game and is extremely easy to learn because it is so informative and inviting to new players unfamiliar with the hobby. In short, Swords \u0026 Wizardry Complete Revised is a beautiful middle ground between the simplicity of original D\u0026D and the complexity of AD\u0026D. It includes nine classes, extended commentary on how to play the game (including gameplay examples), alternative rules for combat, two different saving throw systems, ascending and descending armor class tables, a strong introduction to its magic system, a sample dungeon, extensive tables with recommended values for populating dungeon and wilderness encounters, rules for creature and treasure generation, a host of monsters, and notes on how and why this game is different than the Original D\u0026D on which it is based. It is well-organized and easy to use too, which can’t be said for every retroclone out there. If I need to find something or can’t remember a rule, I know exactly where to find it.\nThere’s also a fifth need/feature that it covers, though I have to admit I assumed it was unfindable in the OSR space given the hobby’s roots in old-school systems. And that is the need to take seriously all of the recent discussions about D\u0026D, racism, sexism, and colonialism. Changing “race” to “ancestry” and using gender neutral pronouns isn’t exactly asking for a lot, but it was encouraging to see that the author, Matt Finch, had made an effort to update the work in this way.\nAfter seeing all that it has to offer, it became evident to me that this was the system I wanted to use.\nFinal Thoughts Keep in mind, however, that there probably isn’t a bad OSR system for solo roleplaying. Some of them, like Mörk Borg, have expansions explicitly meant to make the game solo-friendly. As I’ll point out in a future post, the oracle system I use matters a lot more, as does a certain kind of flexibility concerning strict adherence to the rules.\nAny of the systems mentioned above would be a perfectly good starting point for solo play, and I want to emphasize just how strong I think the White Box and Basic Fantasy rule sets are. You can’t go wrong with either, they are widely available, free in PDF form, and print copies are dirt cheap. If you’re experiencing analysis paralysis, just download one of them and give them a try. You will know pretty quickly whether they are right for you.\n",

<li>It offers an expanded ruleset without over-complicating the game and is extremely easy to learn because it is so informative and inviting to new players unfamiliar with the hobby.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, it combines a low barrier to access with a comprehensive system that is easy to hack and modify for solo gameplay. It also implicitly acknowledges D&amp;D&rsquo;s history of racism and colonialism. The small modifications it makes to common RPG terminology matter and I believe future players of my campaign will appreciate it. There honestly aren&rsquo;t many major changes of that kind in the book, but what is there is a good start.</p>
<p>As I have already said, there probably aren&rsquo;t too many bad system choices for solo play within the OSR constellation of games. As I&rsquo;ll point out in future posts, the oracle system for solo play probably matters a lot more.</p>

<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the long version.</p>
<h2 id="starting-with-dd">Starting with D&amp;D<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#starting-with-dd">#</a></h2>
<p>I decided to try solo roleplaying after watching the inaugural episode of Trevor Devall&rsquo;s <em>Me, Myself, and Die!</em>, but it never occured to me to use the same system he does, which is <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/261539/Savage-Worlds-Adventure-Edition"><em>Savage Worlds</em></a>. I&rsquo;m an RPG fan who has never actually played <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, so I wanted to take a stab at D&amp;D game, or something like it. Sticking to just the official D&amp;D systems, there is no shortage of options. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic">Basic/Expert D&amp;D</a>, or B/X. There are actually a couple of versions of this, but I&rsquo;m going to treat it as a unified thing for this post.</li>
<li><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/116578/d-d-basic-set-player-s-manual-becmi-ed-basic">BECMI</a>, which is actually a series of five books, the first two of which are essentially revisions of the B/X books.</li>
<li><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/17003/players-handbook-1e">AD&amp;D</a> and all of its subsequent editions.</li>
<li><a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/starter-set">5E</a> or fifth edition, which is by far the most-played tabletop RPG in the United States.</li>
<li>and even <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/28306/ODD-Dungeons--Dragons-Original-Edition-0e">Original D&amp;D</a>, often called &ldquo;OD&amp;D&rdquo; or &ldquo;0e.&rdquo; This is the original game that came as a boxed set of three &ldquo;little brown books&rdquo; (you&rsquo;ll see them referred to as &ldquo;LBBs&rdquo; a lot).</li>
</ul>
<p>Distinguishing them all isn&rsquo;t very difficult, but the landscape is complicated by the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_retro-clones">&ldquo;retroclones&rdquo;</a>, which are basically copies of the old D&amp;D rulesets modified in a variety of ways, usually to make the rules clearer and the games easier to play. Many of them are inexpensive, and some are even free, which makes investigating them easy enough. Speaking broadly, they are almost all written and championed by &ldquo;OSR&rdquo; enthusiasts. &ldquo;OSR&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;old school renaissance&rdquo; and it refers both to a style of roleplaying and to the community of people who play and write about old-school style RPGs.</p>
<p>What makes an RPG old-school? There are <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/roleplaying-game/feature/what-is-osr-old-school-rpg-classic-dnd">entire articles written about this</a>, but for my purposes an RPG is old-school if it emphasizes spontaneity and flexibility in gameplay rulings over strict adherence to the rules as written. To offer a ludicrous but illustrative example: does one of your players want to cartwheel through a dungeon encounter with swords taped to their arms and legs in an effort to mow through a mob of kobolds like a combine harvester? Make them describe how they do it first, then try to come up with a rule to determine whether they are successful. There isn&rsquo;t a feat to refer to in the rules, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the effort is off limits, so work with the player to make it a reality (and possibly a hilarious failure). It&rsquo;s old-school in some sense because the lack of a rule doesn&rsquo;t imply the impossibility of the play.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Renaissance">Wikipedia offers a decent overview of it if you want to read more</a>, and I will fill in some more detail below.</p>
<p>But I want to talk a little about why I went with an OSR game in the first place and then I want to focus on the four things that were important to me when deciding which game I would choose.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-osr">Why the OSR?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-the-osr">#</a></h2>
<p>When I watched Trevor Devall play, I lit up at the way he created his characters and worlds more than I did at the combat. What mattered wasn&rsquo;t which dice he was rolling or the precise rules for how he resolved his conflicts, but the way he used his system to navigate the process of being both a player and a gamemaster (GM) at the same time. He generated drama, surprise, tension, comedy, and some fantastic crescendos with little more than random tables and an interest in the materials of his world. Watching him improvise was a ton of fun, and he had an easy time using multiple resources within the same game. They were compatible because they didn&rsquo;t depend on exclusive rules.</p>
<p>This convinced me that working with a simplified or relatively light ruleset would be best.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;m an inexperienced GM and player. The easier a game is to run, the easier it will be for me to get into the swing of playing it.</p>
<p>Second, I wanted the rules of the game to guide me, but I didn&rsquo;t want to spend sessions looking up complex rules for feats, skill checks, persuasion, ability modifiers, and so on. I&rsquo;ve played games with rules that actually get in the way of having fun, and while that can be overcome with experience, I wanted to avoid that obstacle as much as possible.</p>
<p>Third, being able to synthesize rules, ideas, monsters, and other assets from a variety of resources was intriguing because I have so many books in my collection already. Using them together means engaging with more of my collection, but it also means having more options.</p>
<p>This describes many OSR rulesets. The entire philosophy behind the way they are played includes principles like <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rN5w4-azTq3Kbn0Yvk9nfqQhwQ1R5by1/view">&ldquo;rulings over rules&rdquo; and &ldquo;let them [the players] off the rails.&rdquo;</a> In other words, they emphasize improvisation, creativity, and rules-light gaming while still encouraging consistency, challenge, and logical consequence. Generating house rules and rolling with the punches <em>is expected.</em> That&rsquo;s exactly what I wanted, especially since playing solo requires utilizing a second set of rules to simulate the presence of a separate GM (again, I&rsquo;ll talk about this more in my post on oracles).</p>
<p>I could have picked a system written for solo play in mind. Lots of these exist, and some of them can be used for a multiplayer campaign, but I kept floating in the OSR&rsquo;s direction because of that improvisational emphasis.</p>
<h2 id="the-four-factors">The Four Factors<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-four-factors">#</a></h2>
<p>Having settled on something within the OSR universe, I still had a large number of rulebooks to sort through. Here&rsquo;s just a small sampling of the possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/359869/osric"><em>OSRIC</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/279183/old-school-essentials-classic-fantasy-rules-tome"><em>Old School Essentials</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/442921/basic-fantasy-rpg-core-rules-4thed"><em>Basic Fantasy</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/64331/labyrinth-lord-revised-edition-no-art-version"><em>Labyrinth Lord</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/190631/White-Box--Fantastic-Medieval-Adventure-Game"><em>White Box: Fantastic Medieval Adventure Game</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/295910/moerk-borg-english"><em>Mörk Borg</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/101050/Dungeon-Crawl-Classics-RPG-DCC-RPG"><em>Dungeon Crawl Classics</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, <em>Swords &amp; Wizardry Complete Revised</em>. Several of these are offered for free as PDFs, but what is offered in the free versions varies from book to book. Some such editions are missing artwork or they only provide a small subsection of their rules and tools, usually those identified as a part of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Reference_Document">system reference document (SRD)</a>.</p>
<p><em>Basic Fantasy</em> actually offers its complete ruleset for free in digital form, along with literally every single one of its modules and expansions. And printed versions of many of its books can be had for cheap through Amazon or Lulu&rsquo;s print-on-demand services. This was very nearly the system I decided to use because it wasn&rsquo;t going to cost me a thing to run it.</p>
<p>Then I read <em>White Box: Fantastic Medieval Adventure</em> and was amazed. The entire book is brief (144 pp.), well-written, well-organized, and free. I read through it in less than a day and felt like I knew the system before I was finished. It features minimal, but helpful advice on how to run the game and includes a lot of monster and treasure information, which makes getting started a breeze. I figured I could combine it with content from <em>Basic Fantasy</em> and be ready to go. It also has three of the four most important features of a core book for my purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is rules-light, with an emphasis on improvisation and house rules.</li>
<li>It is inexpensive. Not having to invest a lot matters to me, and some of the most popular rule sets are relatively expensive even in PDF form.</li>
<li>It is compatible with a lot of OSR content, including modules originally designed for other versions of D&amp;D.</li>
</ol>
<p>But then I found out <em>White Box</em> was based on something called <em>Swords and Wizardry</em> and <em>that</em> game had a brand new edition that had just been released. It took only a glance at its sample materials and table of contents to realize that this was my system of of choice. It had the same three features as <em>White Box</em>, but it hit on the fourth and maybe most important feature:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>It offers an expanded ruleset without over-complicating the game and is extremely easy to learn because it is so informative and inviting to new players unfamiliar with the hobby.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, <em>Swords &amp; Wizardry Complete Revised</em> is a beautiful middle ground between the simplicity of original D&amp;D and the complexity of AD&amp;D. It includes nine classes, extended commentary on how to play the game (including gameplay examples), alternative rules for combat, two different saving throw systems, ascending and descending armor class tables, a strong introduction to its magic system, a sample dungeon, extensive tables with recommended values for populating dungeon and wilderness encounters, rules for creature and treasure generation, a host of monsters, and notes on how and why this game is different than the Original D&amp;D on which it is based. It is well-organized and easy to use too, which can&rsquo;t be said for every retroclone out there. If I need to find something or can&rsquo;t remember a rule, I know exactly where to find it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a fifth need/feature that it covers, though I have to admit I assumed it was unfindable in the OSR space given the hobby&rsquo;s roots in old-school systems. And that is the need to take seriously all of the recent discussions about <a href="https://feartheswarth.wordpress.com/2020/02/28/the-truth-of-colonialism-in-dd/">D&amp;D, racism, sexism, and colonialism</a>. Changing &ldquo;race&rdquo; to &ldquo;ancestry&rdquo; and using gender neutral pronouns isn&rsquo;t exactly asking for a lot, but it was encouraging to see that the author, Matt Finch, had made an effort to update the work in this way.</p>
<p>After seeing all that it has to offer, it became evident to me that this was the system I wanted to use.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#final-thoughts">#</a></h2>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that there probably isn&rsquo;t a <em>bad</em> OSR system for solo roleplaying. Some of them, like <em>Mörk Borg</em>, have expansions explicitly meant to make the game solo-friendly. As I&rsquo;ll point out in a future post, the oracle system I use matters a lot more, as does a certain kind of flexibility concerning strict adherence to the rules.</p>
<p>Any of the systems mentioned above would be a perfectly good starting point for solo play, and I want to emphasize just how strong I think the <em>White Box</em> and <em>Basic Fantasy</em> rule sets are. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with either, they are widely available, <em>free</em> in PDF form, and print copies are dirt cheap. If you&rsquo;re experiencing analysis paralysis, just download one of them and give them a try. You will know pretty quickly whether they are right for you.</p>
