[{"content":"The game I\u0026rsquo;m running now features a cleric whose primary strength is the connection he has accidentally established with his god. This god, however, will only speak to him through mystical visions, dreams, and especially nightmares. It\u0026rsquo;s a blessing and a curse for him, and a helpful way for me to keep the story moving in unpredictable directions. Intrepreting images and dream content is a lot of fun on its own, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a useful mechanic for playing solo RPGS.\nUp to this point, whenever my Cleric has had a vision, I have simply gone with the first two or three images that have come to my mind. For example, if the oracle system I am using tells me that the cleric is going to have a visionary dream, I will force myself to spit out three nouns as quickly as possible, with as little thinking as I can manage. In last night\u0026rsquo;s session, that was \u0026ldquo;waterfall, horse, rope.\u0026rdquo;\nThen, I force myself to find a noun, again as quickly as possible. Last night, it was \u0026ldquo;eating\u0026rdquo; (I was hungry).\nHow do I put them together? It all depends on the context of the story, but that\u0026rsquo;s really no different than rolling dice and using an oracle to get nouns and verbs for a random event. In my campaign, the Cleric discovered from locals that there is a large ranch near a local waterfall, which makes sense of the first two images. I had to roll a bit more to make sense of rope, but this congealed into a revelation that the stablemaster was once a prisoner. The \u0026ldquo;eating\u0026rdquo; part was easy. In my game, people are being poisoned by tainted medicine. The culprit is still up in the air. Perhaps this is my first lead?\nBut sometimes I am tired and can\u0026rsquo;t come up with fresh images very easily, or I keep repeating images from within a network of related ideas: ball, orb, sphere, planet, moon, etc. To help me along, I got a little ambitious and decided to draft my first ever d100 table, which I offer below.\nThe idea here is to roll 1d100 once or twice and use the resulting images as inspiration for a mystical vision, dream, or nightmare. If they contradict each other, all the better: dreams don\u0026rsquo;t always make sense, but contradictions make for interesting sources of tension and mystery.\nOf course, you should feel free to hack this and use it in whatever way you find interesting. There\u0026rsquo;s a decent amount of random imagery here, so I can imagine it being used in a variety of ways.\nHappy questing!\nDownload: d100 table of mystical visions, dreams, and nightmares (PDF)\nDownload: d100 table of mystical visions, dreams, and nightmares (ODT) ","permalink":"https://booperdcss.github.io/3dBooper/2024/3d4/","summary":"A table of random visions for clairvoyants, dreamers, and cursed prophets","title":"d100 Mystical Visions, Dreams, and Nightmares"},{"content":"Roll for surprise! Roll for initiative! I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing my solo game for a couple of weeks now and have made a substantial (but I think logical) change to the combat rules that I want to share. I am aware other people must have had this idea already, but it has made a big impression on me.\nImagine this for a moment.\nMy party is searching through a network of caves, hoping to find a holy symbol that the leading character has seen in a vision. It is an artifact of great power, mythic even, but it\u0026rsquo;s also unstable. Dangerous. Maybe evil.\nThe caves are notorious for being filled with kobolds and goblins and there are countless rumors and legends about people disappearing inside them. Entire caverns are said to move around, as if they magically switch positions within the caves.\nPeople lose their memories and emerge days later, unsure what has happened to them.\nAnimals that venture into the caves sometimes emerge mutated and sickly.\nThe party has been dilligent about gathering this information. They\u0026rsquo;re ready for this. They are moving carefully, keeping quiet, looking out for traps\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip; and I am rolling for random encounters at semi-regular intervals. What they are doing is dangerous; some would call it crazy. I don\u0026rsquo;t want it to be easy.\nAnd then I roll up a pair of goblins emerging from the darkness.\nTo the rulebook! First things first: check for surprise. Roll the dice. The party is surprised. Damn. Next, check for reaction. Are the goblins hostile? Roll the dice. They definitely are. My party is treating their home like a tourist attraction after all. This is going to be bad.\nOr maybe it goes another way. Check for surprise. Roll the dice. Nope, no surprises here. Maybe we should check for reaction anyway. I like that rule. Are the goblins hostile? Oh yeah. Bad luck for the party, but they want blood. Now, roll for initiative. Oh this is going to be a bloody mess for my level one adventurers: the goblins have the upper hand!\nBut wait a second. My party was moving carefully. They were on the lookout for traps, and you better believe they were listening for footfalls, conversation, and other noises. This place is a death trap and they are scared to be here, but they are smart enough to look for signs of life. And how were these goblins moving through the cave? Can they see in the dark? Or do they have a lantern too? Would my party have seen it coming? And would the goblins have seen our light in advance?\nI recently read a great post by Jared Sinclair called \u0026ldquo;Rules Elide\u0026rdquo; and Its Consequences. You should read it, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to summarize it for the purposes of this post and offer this basic formulation of its argument: RPG rules get rid of details about actions that players are uninterested in managing and allows them to focus on what they enjoy without removing that action from the game. In other words, rules get rid of details when they are a bother, or they simplify complex actions that are hard to fictionalize in a convncing and consistent way.\nThe example of lockpicking in that post is perfect. You can either describe the methodology for picking a lock methodically, thus convincing the GM that the lock has been picked, or you can flip a coin and pick the lock if it lands heads up. Do you care enough about the locks to go all out in your description? Or do you really just want to get it out of the way so you can get back to the exploration you care about?\nThis kind of elision happens all over the place when we play RPGs, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine. But sometimes, when we sort through the details, we stumble on ideas and surprises that make the \u0026ldquo;more important\u0026rdquo; bits even richer than they might have been on their own. Sometimes, it is just as much fun to slow down, think through the fiction of the situation, and bring the world of the game to life by dealing with its smaller details. And I think the beginning of combat encounters in old-school D\u0026amp;D games benefit in a special way from just such a detailed approach, whether you care more about actual combat, the fiction of the setting, world-building, or some other element of play.\nWhat the hell are the monsters doing? There\u0026rsquo;s a great post by Nick LS Whelan over at Papers \u0026amp; Pencils that completely reimagines RPG encounter tables. Because I want to experience playing at least some of Swords \u0026amp; Wizardry as written, I decided not to completely revamp the process, but I did find some inspiration in Nick\u0026rsquo;s idea of a \u0026ldquo;wrinkle.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a wrinkle?\nIn short, monsters should be doing something when you come across them. They don\u0026rsquo;t exist merely as obstacles for the party, but have a life of their own, probably one that contributes to the fiction of the place where they exist. This is a wrinkle because it takes the idea of an encounter out of the purely combative and bunches it up, giving it texture and meaning in multiple dimensions.\nI love this idea, so I took the d30 table and edited it slightly for an easy d12 or d20 roll. In total imitation of Nick\u0026rsquo;s idea, I use d12 dice for animal encounters and d20 for creatures that behave more or less like humans. If I roll an animal-like activity on a human-like creature, I just improvise. It\u0026rsquo;s not hard imagining any of these activites in a person, a kobold, or a dragon.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Monsters Doing\u0026rdquo; Table Roll Activity/Status 1 Lost 2 Hurt 3 Trapped 4 Sleeping 5 Eating 6 Tracking prey 7 Lying in ambush 8 Seeking a mate 9 Starving 10 Fleeing from something 11 Resting, but aware 12 Marking its territory 13 Scavenging 14 Building a camp 15 Searching for something 16 Holding captives 17 Cooking 18 Drugs/drinking 19 Destroying something 20 Performing a ritual But if the monsters are doing something, doesn\u0026rsquo;t that alter what happens when you encounter them? Might that not create surprise? Or alert the party to their existence in advance?\nIf a group of goblins are found building a camp or holding captives, don\u0026rsquo;t you think they would make a lot of noise? What if they were cooking or performing a ritual? Would the party notice before they encountered them?\nSuddenly this flat thing (rolling for surprise) has dramatic potential. Who are the captives? What ritual are the goblins performing? Oh god, why did the party have to stumble on 2d6 giant rats in the middle of their mating rituals?\nHow do they react? How do you react? One of the most helpful combat notes in Swords \u0026amp; Wizardry is concerned with monster reaction. It\u0026rsquo;s brief and maybe a little easy to miss, but it\u0026rsquo;s juicy:\nTake note: Monsters do not always leap to the attack. Unless they are on the alert for intruders, the Referee may roll 2d6 to determine whether the monsters attack if they surprise the adventurers. On a roll of 2–6, the monsters are hostile and attack; on a roll of 7–9, the monsters withhold judgment and wait to see if the adventurers are hostile; on a roll of 10–12, the monsters have a positive initial reaction to seeing the adventurers and might even be convinced to offer some help — if they are well paid, of course! (from page 35 of the Complete Revised edition; emphasis mine)\nIf the monsters surprise the party, I can roll to see how the monsters react. Maybe they have the upper hand but don\u0026rsquo;t realize it. Or maybe they aren\u0026rsquo;t willing to engage in a battle because they are more concerned with another task. It\u0026rsquo;s random, but it gives the situation more life.\nBut if the monsters are cooking, could they possibly surprise the party? Isn\u0026rsquo;t it more likely the party would surprise them? Why roll on a table at all when the fiction established by the \u0026ldquo;Monster Doing\u0026rdquo; roll already tells us so much?\nRolling for monster reactions may still be relevant if their reaction isn\u0026rsquo;t clear from their activity (if goblins are patrolling, they\u0026rsquo;re looking for intruders, and are probably ready to face them, but maybe the party greatly outnumbers them). Here is a place where we can replace the rules with narrative, drama, and world-building, and in solo play the opportunity to engage in any of those is almost always worth taking.\nRoll for uh\u0026hellip; wait, didn\u0026rsquo;t we see them first? Up to this point, we\u0026rsquo;ve transformed two simple dice rolls (surprise, reaction) into a chance for interacting with the fictional world of the game. My party of cave-diving opportunists might have an encounter that looks like this:\nRoll random encounter. It\u0026rsquo;s a pair of goblins. Roll on the \u0026ldquo;Monster Doing\u0026rdquo; table. They are clearly searching for something. The sound of rocks, small boulders, and chatter were easily discernable from (2d6 x 10) feet away. I made that last bit up on the spot, but I could create rules for sound traveling if I wanted. Also note, it\u0026rsquo;s OK to retroactively change the encounter and put the party well outside the goblin\u0026rsquo;s notice; encounter isn\u0026rsquo;t the same as contact.\nAs the party moves forward silently and nears a turn in the tunnels, they spy a flash a light from further into the caves. They decide to dim their own light and agree that the thief should scout ahead as quietly as possible.\nThe thief is able to hide behind a large outcropping of stone and sees two goblins working frantically at a pile of loose debris in the corner of a large opening in the cave (roll 2d20 to come up with random room dimensions). The floor drops away 10 or 15 feet, but the ceiling climbs at least 30 feet at the same time. The thief is above them. The dull glow of a lantern reaches nearly to the top.\nOne goblin speaks in the common tongue: \u0026ldquo;Gravik swears this is where he fell. The (roll on random table) key has to be here somewhere.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat a discovery! An encounter that might have inevitably led to combat (roll surprise, roll reaction, get those spells ready) becomes an encounter where the party gets new information and, should they desire, the opportunity to surprise the goblins themselves.\nNow the party approaches the opening in the tunnels together. They have agreed the key the goblins mentioned is important and they are willing to kill the goblins for the opportunity to find it themselves. After all, they had been ambushed by goblins just a few hours earlier. These aren\u0026rsquo;t a peaceful group and\u0026hellip; well, the party isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a model of good behavior and virtue either.\nSo roll intiative on the combat!\n\u0026hellip;\nOr just give the party the upper hand.\nNot only can they surprise the goblins, but the fiction of the game has clearly established that they are going to move on the goblins\u0026rsquo; position first and likely have the advantage of shock on their side.\nBut what if the party is weak? What if they are hurt?\nNow, with the table in play, the party can make a number of choices beyond simply risking death. Do they wait for the goblins to leave? Do they run away? Do they watch and wait for more information?\nThe game is no longer on rails. It\u0026rsquo;s alive and capable of moving in many more directions, many of which can be deepened by use of an oracle system. And all thanks to a table that asks a single question: what the heck are these monsters doing when the party encounters them?\nA new order of operations Since introducing the \u0026ldquo;Monsters Doing\u0026rdquo; table to my sessions, I have rewritten the order of operations for combat in Swords \u0026amp; Wizardry. Since surprise, reaction, and initiative can be folded into a single roll in some cases, I\u0026rsquo;ve found it helpful to think about when and how I should make rolls depending on the context.\nI will conclude this post with that process, in case others find it useful, and will only add that this has made my solo games a lot more fun and a lot more unpredictable. I can imagine writing a variety of such \u0026ldquo;doing\u0026rdquo; tables based on the environment or context of play (caves will be different than mountainous paths, and both would differ from river travel, etc.) and a part of me is tempted to write more of these in the near future. For now, though, the idea is enough on its own to make solo play a lot more unpredictable and a lot more fun.\nNew combat procudes Roll on the \u0026ldquo;Monsters Doing\u0026rdquo; table. Roll 1d12 for animals, 1d20 for human-like creatures.\n(optional) If the result necessitates it, check encounter distance by rolling (1d6 x 10 feet). This is the distance between the party and the monsters.\n(optional) Determine surprise if needed.\nRemember, your characters might have heard or suspected the presence of something in a room before entering it. Does their lamp light allow for some suggestion of what is ahead? Could they have smelled something? Felt something? Monsters don\u0026rsquo;t appear from a void of sensation, so think carefully about what must have been happening when your party encountered this group. Remember, it\u0026rsquo;s your game: it\u0026rsquo;s OK to retroactively change the circumstances to fit the fiction! (optional) Check monster reaction, but only if necessary. In combination with the \u0026ldquo;Monsters Doing\u0026rdquo; table, you may get either a sensible or a contradictory combination of information from the reaction roll. If the \u0026ldquo;Doing\u0026rdquo; table is enough, narrate instead of worrying about this.\nDeclare Spells\n(optional) Roll initiative if needed. The fiction established in steps 1-3 may already tell you enough.\nIf this is your second time through the combat loop, rolling initiative may still be necessary. But the fiction of the combat can obviate it. Play in a way that feels comfortable and consistent to you (or to your group, if you\u0026rsquo;re playing outside the solo bubble). When in doubt, check the logic of your fiction before resorting to dice. There may be something buried in the moments leading up to the encounter that make initiative unnecessary. But don\u0026rsquo;t fret if it feels uncomfortable. Initiative isn\u0026rsquo;t bad, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t always necessary either.

There is probably no such thing, and there are too may systems I have never played anyway; and too many more I have never even read. But I did a lot of research before making a choice for myself and I can share why I landed on Swords \u0026amp; Wizardry Complete Revised. Here\u0026rsquo;s the short version:\nAdaptable and flexible systems are more important to me than almost anything else. Once I stopped worrying about the \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; system and paid close attention to what I wanted my system to do for me, the decision almost made itself. I am most interested in building lore, developing characters, and forcing them to make difficult decisions, so finding something with snappy combat mattered. I like fighting just fine, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend all my time there. Looking through OSR systems seemed a natural first choice (more on that below). Swords and Wizardry Complete Revised offers a rules-light system that encourages improvisation and the creation of house rules. That alone is a great foundation for solo play. It\u0026rsquo;s inexpensive even in its complete version. Giving it a shot costs very little. It is compatible with a ton of cheap, easy-to-find, and well-written material that can be found all over the Internet, including a whole host of classic D\u0026amp;D modules. It offers an expanded ruleset without over-complicating the game and is extremely easy to learn because it is so informative and inviting to new players unfamiliar with the hobby. In summary, it combines a low barrier to access with a comprehensive system that is easy to hack and modify for solo gameplay. It also implicitly acknowledges D\u0026amp;D\u0026rsquo;s history of racism and colonialism. The small modifications it makes to common RPG terminology matter and I believe future players of my campaign will appreciate it. There honestly aren\u0026rsquo;t many major changes of that kind in the book, but what is there is a good start.\nAs I have already said, there probably aren\u0026rsquo;t too many bad system choices for solo play within the OSR constellation of games. As I\u0026rsquo;ll point out in future posts, the oracle system for solo play probably matters a lot more.\nQuick note: I link to DriveThruRPG because they host free official content from various publishers. Using their site is largely a matter of convenience. I do not work for them nor do I make money from them if you click on my links.\nNow, here\u0026rsquo;s the long version.\nStarting with D\u0026amp;D I decided to try solo roleplaying after watching the inaugural episode of Trevor Devall\u0026rsquo;s Me, Myself, and Die!, but it never occured to me to use the same system he does, which is Savage Worlds. I\u0026rsquo;m an RPG fan who has never actually played Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, so I wanted to take a stab at D\u0026amp;D game, or something like it. Sticking to just the official D\u0026amp;D systems, there is no shortage of options. They include:\nBasic/Expert D\u0026amp;D, or B/X. There are actually a couple of versions of this, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to treat it as a unified thing for this post. BECMI, which is actually a series of five books, the first two of which are essentially revisions of the B/X books. AD\u0026amp;D and all of its subsequent editions. 5E or fifth edition, which is by far the most-played tabletop RPG in the United States. and even Original D\u0026amp;D, often called \u0026ldquo;OD\u0026amp;D\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;0e.\u0026rdquo; This is the original game that came as a boxed set of three \u0026ldquo;little brown books\u0026rdquo; (you\u0026rsquo;ll see them referred to as \u0026ldquo;LBBs\u0026rdquo; a lot). Distinguishing them all isn\u0026rsquo;t very difficult, but the landscape is complicated by the existence of \u0026ldquo;retroclones\u0026rdquo;, which are basically copies of the old D\u0026amp;D rulesets modified in a variety of ways, usually to make the rules clearer and the games easier to play. Many of them are inexpensive, and some are even free, which makes investigating them easy enough. Speaking broadly, they are almost all written and championed by \u0026ldquo;OSR\u0026rdquo; enthusiasts. \u0026ldquo;OSR\u0026rdquo; stands for \u0026ldquo;old school renaissance\u0026rdquo; and it refers both to a style of roleplaying and to the community of people who play and write about old-school style RPGs.\nWhat makes an RPG old-school? There are entire articles written about this, but for my purposes an RPG is old-school if it emphasizes spontaneity and flexibility in gameplay rulings over strict adherence to the rules as written. To offer a ludicrous but illustrative example: does one of your players want to cartwheel through a dungeon encounter with swords taped to their arms and legs in an effort to mow through a mob of kobolds like a combine harvester? Make them describe how they do it first, then try to come up with a rule to determine whether they are successful. There isn\u0026rsquo;t a feat to refer to in the rules, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean the effort is off limits, so work with the player to make it a reality (and possibly a hilarious failure). It\u0026rsquo;s old-school in some sense because the lack of a rule doesn\u0026rsquo;t imply the impossibility of the play.\nWikipedia offers a decent overview of it if you want to read more, and I will fill in some more detail below.\nBut I want to talk a little about why I went with an OSR game in the first place and then I want to focus on the four things that were important to me when deciding which game I would choose.\nWhy the OSR? When I watched Trevor Devall play, I lit up at the way he created his characters and worlds more than I did at the combat. What mattered wasn\u0026rsquo;t which dice he was rolling or the precise rules for how he resolved his conflicts, but the way he used his system to navigate the process of being both a player and a gamemaster (GM) at the same time. He generated drama, surprise, tension, comedy, and some fantastic crescendos with little more than random tables and an interest in the materials of his world. Watching him improvise was a ton of fun, and he had an easy time using multiple resources within the same game. They were compatible because they didn\u0026rsquo;t depend on exclusive rules.\nThis convinced me that working with a simplified or relatively light ruleset would be best.\nWhy?\nFirst, I\u0026rsquo;m an inexperienced GM and player. The easier a game is to run, the easier it will be for me to get into the swing of playing it.\nSecond, I wanted the rules of the game to guide me, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend sessions looking up complex rules for feats, skill checks, persuasion, ability modifiers, and so on. I\u0026rsquo;ve played games with rules that actually get in the way of having fun, and while that can be overcome with experience, I wanted to avoid that obstacle as much as possible.\nThird, being able to synthesize rules, ideas, monsters, and other assets from a variety of resources was intriguing because I have so many books in my collection already. Using them together means engaging with more of my collection, but it also means having more options.\nThis describes many OSR rulesets. The entire philosophy behind the way they are played includes principles like \u0026ldquo;rulings over rules\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;let them [the players] off the rails.\u0026rdquo; In other words, they emphasize improvisation, creativity, and rules-light gaming while still encouraging consistency, challenge, and logical consequence. Generating house rules and rolling with the punches is expected. That\u0026rsquo;s exactly what I wanted, especially since playing solo requires utilizing a second set of rules to simulate the presence of a separate GM (again, I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about this more in my post on oracles).\nI could have picked a system written for solo play in mind. Lots of these exist, and some of them can be used for a multiplayer campaign, but I kept floating in the OSR\u0026rsquo;s direction because of that improvisational emphasis.\nThe Four Factors Having settled on something within the OSR universe, I still had a large number of rulebooks to sort through. Here\u0026rsquo;s just a small sampling of the possibilities:\nOSRIC Old School Essentials Basic Fantasy Labyrinth Lord White Box: Fantastic Medieval Adventure Game Mörk Borg Dungeon Crawl Classics And, of course, Swords \u0026amp; Wizardry Complete Revised. Several of these are offered for free as PDFs, but what is offered in the free versions varies from book to book. Some such editions are missing artwork or they only provide a small subsection of their rules and tools, usually those identified as a part of their system reference document (SRD).\nBasic Fantasy actually offers its complete ruleset for free in digital form, along with literally every single one of its modules and expansions. And printed versions of many of its books can be had for cheap through Amazon or Lulu\u0026rsquo;s print-on-demand services. This was very nearly the system I decided to use because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to cost me a thing to run it.\nThen I read White Box: Fantastic Medieval Adventure and was amazed. The entire book is brief (144 pp.), well-written, well-organized, and free. I read through it in less than a day and felt like I knew the system before I was finished. It features minimal, but helpful advice on how to run the game and includes a lot of monster and treasure information, which makes getting started a breeze. I figured I could combine it with content from Basic Fantasy and be ready to go. It also has three of the four most important features of a core book for my purposes:\nIt is rules-light, with an emphasis on improvisation and house rules. It is inexpensive. Not having to invest a lot matters to me, and some of the most popular rule sets are relatively expensive even in PDF form. It is compatible with a lot of OSR content, including modules originally designed for other versions of D\u0026amp;D. But then I found out White Box was based on something called Swords and Wizardry and that game had a brand new edition that had just been released. It took only a glance at its sample materials and table of contents to realize that this was my system of of choice. It had the same three features as White Box, but it hit on the fourth and maybe most important feature:\nIt offers an expanded ruleset without over-complicating the game and is extremely easy to learn because it is so informative and inviting to new players unfamiliar with the hobby. In short, Swords \u0026amp; Wizardry Complete Revised is a beautiful middle ground between the simplicity of original D\u0026amp;D and the complexity of AD\u0026amp;D. It includes nine classes, extended commentary on how to play the game (including gameplay examples), alternative rules for combat, two different saving throw systems, ascending and descending armor class tables, a strong introduction to its magic system, a sample dungeon, extensive tables with recommended values for populating dungeon and wilderness encounters, rules for creature and treasure generation, a host of monsters, and notes on how and why this game is different than the Original D\u0026amp;D on which it is based. It is well-organized and easy to use too, which can\u0026rsquo;t be said for every retroclone out there. If I need to find something or can\u0026rsquo;t remember a rule, I know exactly where to find it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a fifth need/feature that it covers, though I have to admit I assumed it was unfindable in the OSR space given the hobby\u0026rsquo;s roots in old-school systems. And that is the need to take seriously all of the recent discussions about D\u0026amp;D, racism, sexism, and colonialism. Changing \u0026ldquo;race\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;ancestry\u0026rdquo; and using gender neutral pronouns isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly asking for a lot, but it was encouraging to see that the author, Matt Finch, had made an effort to update the work in this way.\nAfter seeing all that it has to offer, it became evident to me that this was the system I wanted to use.\nFinal Thoughts Keep in mind, however, that there probably isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad OSR system for solo roleplaying. Some of them, like Mörk Borg, have expansions explicitly meant to make the game solo-friendly. As I\u0026rsquo;ll point out in a future post, the oracle system I use matters a lot more, as does a certain kind of flexibility concerning strict adherence to the rules.\nAny of the systems mentioned above would be a perfectly good starting point for solo play, and I want to emphasize just how strong I think the White Box and Basic Fantasy rule sets are. You can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with either, they are widely available, free in PDF form, and print copies are dirt cheap. If you\u0026rsquo;re experiencing analysis paralysis, just download one of them and give them a try. You will know pretty quickly whether they are right for you.\n","permalink":"https://booperdcss.github.io/3dBooper/2024/2d25/","summary":"How I decided on a core system for my first solo campaign.","title":"Picking a Core Rulebook"},{"content":"I am a 40-something father of two living near the Great Lakes of North America.

I\u0026rsquo;m not going to beat myself over the head trying to make it perfect.\nBooper is a semi-obscure reference to Twin Peaks and BooperDCSS was created with the intention of contributing more to one of the best computer games you can play anywhere, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.\nBlack Lives Matter and Trans Rights Are Human Rights.

Now, I\u0026rsquo;m taking that frustration and channeling it into a running a solo campaign in the hope of converting it for group play sometime in the future. This blog will document my experiences learning to play solo RPGs and will hopefully generate some useful advice for others interested in the hobby. It will also give me a good excuse to write more. Writing has always improved my mental health and improving my mental health has always improved my thinking.\nA Little Bio I have played computer roleplaying games (CRPGs) and so-called1 Japanese roleplaying games (JRPGs) almost my entire life, ever since I read about Final Fantasy I and picked up a copy for the NES way back in 1990 (thanks, mom and dad). The strategy guide published by Nintendo Power absolutely contributed to my obsession. There were days and weeks that I spent more time looking through that guide than I did actually playing the game. There\u0026rsquo;s always been something special about leafing through RPG books.\nMy preoccupation with tabletop RPGs is almost as old. It was spurred by a friend\u0026rsquo;s older brother, who left his copy of Werewolf: The Apocalypse laying around during a sleepover. I was ten and had no idea how a book could be a game, but the artwork was amazing and I got my first taste of being addicted to character creation that night (or to the idea of it, at least). It felt complicated and a little intimidating, but the concept was exciting. Adding depth and an internal life to the characters I had played in video games felt like a big deal. I kind of did that anyway when I imagined being Cecil in Final Fantasy IV or what it must be like to experience the loss that Cyan does in VI, but the tabletop variety gave that play more shape and centrality.\nSadly, my group of friends never played Werewolf. That older brother refused to even show us how, thus beginning a pattern that repeated a lot through my life.\nI bought a copy of Vampire: The Dark Ages when I was 15, but had trouble finding guidance on how to run it and to this day have never actually played it. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t terribly easy finding tabletop groups where I lived, and I knew more people interested in console gaming. There was little to no guidance available and almost no one was interested in figuring it out with me. I was either too young or my friends were too interested in doing something else with their free time. I was lonely enough and unsure enough of myself to go where my friends did.\nIt would be another 20 years before I actually sat down at a table to play an RPG with other people. A local game shop had a Blades in the Dark night and the GM had a reputation for being very good at what he did. I signed up, had a blast, and bought a copy of the book that same night. A couple of months later, I began my own Blades campaign via Discord with a few people I knew who were specifically interested in that system. It ran for around four or five sessions and felt great. I found that I loved how creative the game asked me to be. I was co-creating worlds, acting, putting together maps, drawing up histories\u0026hellip; in short, exercising my brain in a way that made me feel good like few other hobbies ever have.\nWhen the pandemic hit, life got a little harder and scheduling games became almost impossible. My work schedule and private responsibilities made even virtual events a challenge. But my imagination had been re-ignited and I still loved the big core rule books, their artwork, and the endless tables describing how the game might be played. Plus, I wanted to play more systems, roll more characters, and try to get a sense of what made all these games so different. I bought Dungeon Crawl Classics, The Burning Wheel, and Mörk Borg and spent a lot of time learning each of them. I read histories about Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, watched videos on the differences between B/X and BECMI, spent evenings reading forums explaining what retroclones were and why they existed\u0026hellip; but I still didn\u0026rsquo;t get a chance to play. It could have easily felt like a waste of time, but I found all the little details just as compelling as the books.\nGetting to the point Then, in January of 2024, I stumbled on Me, Myself, and Die!, Trevor Devall\u0026rsquo;s Youtube series on solo tabletop roleplaying. I watched a couple of episodes from the first season and was instantly excited to try it myself. Watching him roll up Simon\u0026rsquo;s history and draw gameplay features from a variety of books was revelatory. I could finally put all my books to use!\nWhich is what I want to document here.\nOver the last month-and-a-half, I\u0026rsquo;ve assembled an oracle and mapping system for myself using a variety of free and paid-for resources. I also did a little research into OSR gaming (because I wanted to play something that emphasized improvisation) and decided that Swords \u0026amp; Wizardry Complete Revised would be my core gaming system.\nNot only is the artwork and writing excellent (and I appreciate the sensitivity to issues of ancestry and gender that Matt Finch seems to have), but the rules are relatively simple and flexible, making homebrew and hacks easy to implement. It\u0026rsquo;s an added bonus that it is compatible with most OSR modules and adventures and cheap in PDF form. Compared to other systems, it has a very low barrier to entry.\nRecording my successes and failures with these systems will be valuable to me on its own, but if anything I write is of help to other people trying to play tabletop RPGs (solo or otherwise), all the better. That\u0026rsquo;s my goal: play the game, write about it, learn from my mistakes, and maybe help some other people along the way.\nEventually, I hope my experiments will lead to a campaign that I can play with others. In the meantime, I\u0026rsquo;ll be rolling dice and writing about what happens when I do.\nThe classification of RPGs into \u0026ldquo;computer\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;western\u0026rdquo;) and \u0026ldquo;Japanese\u0026rdquo; categories is less helpful than it at first appears. It\u0026rsquo;s more of a proxy for the difference between computer and console games in the \u0026rsquo;80s and \u0026rsquo;90s, but even that is fuzzy. There has been a lot written about this lately. Check out Rowan Kaiser\u0026rsquo;s article at Engadget for one argument against the accuracy of this taxonomy. There\u0026rsquo;s a decent Wiki entry on the subject as well.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://booperdcss.github.io/3dBooper/2024/2d24/","summary":"Blogging about the joys and challenges of solo tabletop RPG play.","title":"Statement of Purpose"}]
